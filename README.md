# PrimeNumberCodeTest

 - **How to run it**

Navigate to 'PrimeNumberCodeTest/PrimeNumberCodeTest/bin/Release/' in the folder structure and run PrimeNumberCodeTest.exe. Once run you'll be presented with a text entry field where you can specify the number of prime numbers you want to appear in the generated table.

Once the number has been decided upon simply press 'Generate!' to see the results.

The source code was written using MS Visual Studio Community 2015.
 


 - **What I'm pleased with and what I would do with more time.**

I'm pleased with how simple I made the process of generating a series of prime numbers. I felt using an interface was an elegant approach that kept the code clean and maintainable. With more time I would have liked to explore different algorithms. I had originally planned to use both the Sieve of Eratosthenes and the Sieve of Atkin to compare and contrast the speed of each algorithm, particularly with larger data sets.
